    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating software, scripts, and programs; the structure of your code can take many forms, each called a paradigm, but the one which will be focused on here is Object-Oriented programming. This paradigm is focused on data, state, and operations on either being closely connected inside abstractions called \"objects\". This is contrasted with things like Functional Programming and Procedure-Oriented programming. In Functional Programming, state does not exist and building up functionality is done purely through a chain of manipulations of data (Mathematica being an example). Whereas in Procedure-Oriented Programming, the program is just a list of instructions with almost no higher abstract concepts (Bash scripting being an example). These are mostly defined to help guide you, no one type of programming is better than the other; as long as your code fulfills your needs whether it's speed, maintainability, readibility, ease of prototyping, or any other requirement. \n",
    "\n",
    "To begin working with object-oriented programming the best place to start is to think about \"Interfaces\", an interface is designing an object by thinking about how a programmer, you, or other pieces of code will interact with your data then designing objects around that. That said, when beginning to learn about how to build your code's interfaces, it is often useful to discusss specific Object-Oriented programming \"design patterns\" which helps you to think about your code and it's design. In this document we are going to focus on two \"design patterns\":\n",
    "- Inheritance, where objects behaviors are derived from thier type \n",
    "- Composition, where objects behaviors are given to them by other objects they hold\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to walk through each of these we are going to convert the following piece of Procedure-Oriented programming code into each Object-Oriented style"

    "## Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is focused on the construction of types and behaviors associated with those types, colloqially called the \"is a\" relationship. For example given a list of animals: dog, sheep, goldfish, eagle; you would say they are all \"animals\" so you would make an `Animal` parent class (all of which make a noise), then start to specialize that `Animal` class by inheriting from it to define thier behaviors (barking, baaing, glupping, cawing). Using this idea, in the following example we made a `Directory` object to hold and get data from our employees. Our `Directory` interface will therefore search the employees it knows about and return the relevant information we want. To make the employees, we then make a parent \"Employee\" class which has attributes which we know all employees have, namely a salary and name, and then inherit that parent class into the different roles we want to create namely `Worker` and `Manager` to set the parameters associated with each role.
